#Special patterns
- This is a Bash script that generates a diamond pattern made of dots ('.'). The size of the diamond is determined by the user input

#Pre-requisites:
- Linux
- Bash shell

#Process:
- Create a new file and save it with a `.sh extension`, such as `specialpattern.sh`.
- Navigate to the directory where the `specialpattern.sh` file is located.
- Run the script by executing the following command `bash ./specialpattern.sh`
- The script will prompt you to enter a number between `5 and 9`.
- It checks if the user input is within the range of `5 to 9`. If not, it displays an `error message and exits`.
- The diamond pattern is created using nested loops to generate the required `number of spaces and dots`.
- The pattern is displayed in the `terminal`.

#Factorial
- This is a simple Bash script that calculates the factorial of a given number.

#Pre-requisites:
- Linux
- bash shell

#Process:
- Create a new file and save it with a  `.sh` extension, such as `factorial.sh`.
- Navigate to the directory where the `factorial.sh` file is located.
- Run the script by executing the following command `bash ./factorial.sh`.
- The script will prompt you to enter a number for which you want to calculate the factorial.
- The script will then calculate the factorial of the entered number and display the result.

#Variables:
- The script uses a `while loop`to calculate the factorial iteratively.
- The factorial of a number is calculated by `multiplying the number with all the positive integers less than it`.
- The result is stored in the `fact` variable and displayed at the end.
